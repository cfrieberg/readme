### 👨‍💻 **About Me**

When I'm not diving into the world of **cloud engineering** or **IT Services**, I spend my time **futures day trading** the /ES S&P 500 using **technical analysis** and the **opening range breakout strategy**. I'm passionate about working with **customizable algorithmic indicators**, collecting data sets, and refining strategies to improve my win rate. Oh, and did I mention? I'm also a **certified prop firm trader** on the side!

Outside of trading, I have a busy household with **3 dogs**—Kylo, Bodie, and Pete—and my adorable **hedgehog**, Tulip. I love spending time with my girlfriend, friends, and family here in beautiful **Colorado**, whether we're hiking, attending **music shows**, playing **pool**, riding **bikes**, visiting **haunted houses**, or enjoying local **breweries**. Life’s all about the fun stuff!
